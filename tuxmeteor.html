<h1>Tux Meteor</h1>

Tux Meteor is a meteor counting program I hacked up because I wanted to
be able to contribute to the meteor counts going on for this year's
Leonid storm, and I didn't want to have to boot into Windows to use
the existing Windows meteor counter.
<p>
The idea is, while you're lounging on a lawn chair watching the show
with a nice warm blanket over you,
you put your laptop in your lap (thus helping to warm your lap, under
the blanket so the bright CRT doesn't destroy everyone's night vision)
and click mouse buttons or keys on the keyboard every time you see a
meteor.  These events all get logged to a file, so you can take the
data later and make a graph of meteor frequency vs. time, or whatever.

<p>
Tux Meteor can now run as a console app, without X.
This saves batteries on some laptops, and also should make it much
more portable to non-X platforms such as OS X or Zaurus.

<p>
Download the tarball here:
<a href="tuxmeteor/tuxmeteor-0.4.tar.gz">tuxmeteor-0.4.tar.gz</a>.

<p>
It logs the time of each meteor, and which key or button was used to
log it, so you can use different keys/buttons for different brightnesses
or parts of the sky.

<p>
The log file is <i>$HOME/.tuxmeteor/meteors</i>

<p>
When you run tuxmeteor, q will quit; any other key or mouse button
will count as a meteor.

<p>
<a href="meteor2plot.py">Here is a python script</a> which can
take the output and turn it into a file suitable for passing to
gnuplot.  (Run meteor2plot.py binsize filename)

<p>
<a href="../leonids2002/">Here are some plots</a> from Tux Meteor data.

<h2>Installing</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/akkana/tuxmeteor">TuxMeteor is now on GitHub.</a>
You can check it out from there, or extract the tarball below.
<p>
Either way, type <code>make</code> and hopefully it will build.
The binary is called tuxmeteor; you can run it from the build directory,
or run <code>make install</code> to install it to /usr/local/bin.
