Tux Meteor is a meteor counting program.

It logs the time of each meteor, and which key or button was used to
log it, so you can use different keys/buttons for different brightnesses
or parts of the sky.

The log file is $HOME/.tuxmeteor/meteors
It appends to the current file.

Type "make" to build Tux Meteor.

When you run tuxmeteor, q will quit; any other key or mouse button
will count as a meteor.
