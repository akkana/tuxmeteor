Tux Meteor is a meteor counting program, written by Akkana Peck.

It logs the time of each meteor, and which key or button was used to
log it, so you can use different keys/buttons for different brightnesses
or parts of the sky.

Type "make" to build Tux Meteor.
By default, it will try to find your X11 libraries and build with them.
If it gets this wrong, or if you want to override the default and build
with or without X, see the comments at the beginning of the Makefile.

When you run tuxmeteor, q will quit; any other key (or mouse button,
if you've built with X11) will count as a meteor.
tuxmeteor -t will run in terminal mode
(useful if you've built with X11 support).

The log file is $HOME/.tuxmeteor/meteors
It appends to the existing file if one is already there.
